3-Minute Talk: Buffer Overflow in CTF (picoCTF)
Today, I’ll walk you through how I approached and solved the x-sixty-what challenge from picoCTF. This challenge is focused on exploiting a buffer overflow in a 64-bit environment, requiring us to overflow a buffer and modify the return address to execute the flag() function in the program.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Challenge Setup: The challenge provided us with an x86_64 executable. Our objective was to perform a buffer overflow and control the return pointer to jump into the flag function. The challenge’s connection information was provided with nc saturn.picoctf.net 60688.

2. Offset Calculation: After analyzing the binary, I determined that the buffer had an overflow vulnerability with a specific offset of 72 bytes. This was the number of bytes required to fill up the buffer and reach the return instruction pointer (RIP).

3. Identifying the Flag Function: Using gdb or similar debugging tools, I located the address of the flag() function within the program, which was 0x40123B. This address is where we want to redirect the program execution after the overflow.

4. Payload Construction: The payload consists of:

Filling the buffer with 72 bytes of junk data (As).
Appending the memory address of the flag() function using struct.pack() to ensure proper little-endian format for the 64-bit system.
Once the payload was crafted, I used Python’s socket module to interact with the remote service and send the payload.

5. Executing the Exploit: By connecting to the remote server and sending the payload, I was able to overwrite the return address and execute the flag() function, retrieving the flag. The script checks the response for the flag format and prints the result.

Code Walkthrough:
Below is the Python script that automates the entire process, from crafting the payload to sending it and printing the flag.
