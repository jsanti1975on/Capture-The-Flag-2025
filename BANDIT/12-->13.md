Conclusion
The password for Bandit Level 13 was successfully retrieved by reversing the sequence of compressions applied to the original file. This challenge helped reinforce the importance of understanding file formats and the tools available in Linux for handling various types of compressed files.

# Bandit Level 12 → Level 13 Solution

## Objective

The challenge was to retrieve the password for the next level, which was stored in a heavily compressed file. The `data.txt` file was a hexdump of this compressed file, requiring multiple steps of decompression to extract the password.

## Detailed Solution

1. **Create a Temporary Directory:**

   To ensure a clean working environment, I created a temporary directory:

   tmp_dir=$(mktemp -d)
   cd $tmp_dir
2.	Copy and Reverse the Hexdump:
I copied the data.txt file and reversed the hexdump:
cp ~/data.txt .
xxd -r data.txt > data.bin
3.	Decompression Steps:
The following steps were used to decompress the file:
o	The first file identified was a gzip file, which I decompressed with:
mv data.bin data.gz
gunzip data.gz
o	The next file was a POSIX tar archive, which I extracted with:
tar xvf data
o	Further decompressions included handling bzip2 and additional tar files until finally reaching a file named data8.
4.	Extracting the Final Password:
The final file, data8, contained the ASCII text with the password:
cat data8
Password:
FO5dwFs.......................
Summary
The Bandit Level 12 → Level 13 challenge required understanding file formats and systematically decompressing and extracting the contents until the password was revealed. This was an excellent exercise in using Linux command-line tools to manipulate and analyze files.
