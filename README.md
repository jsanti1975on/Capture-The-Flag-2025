# CTF Payloads & Exploits

## About This Repository
Hello! Iâ€™m a student in the 2025 Network Engineering and Cyber Security A.S. degree program at my local state college. This repository contains crafted payloads and automated scripts designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.

These scripts are intended for legal, educational, and ethical use in controlled environments like CTF competitions, TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and lab environments.
